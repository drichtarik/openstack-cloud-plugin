  OpenStack has multiple ways of storing the data necessary for booting up a new instances.
  This plugin supports the following boot sources:
  <dl>
    <dt>Image</dt>
    <dd>
    A bootable filesystem stored on OpenStack's "image store".
    Images or Snapshots get copied to the "compute node" before being booted.
    The instance is given a writable copy which is disposed of when the
    instance itself is destroyed.
    </dd>
    <dt>Volume Snapshot</dt>
    <dd>
    A bootable filesystem stored on OpenStack's "block storage".
    Booting from a Volume Snapshot requires OpenStack to create a new volume
    for the instance to boot from, which will automatically be deleted when
    the instance itself is destroyed.
    </dd>
    <dt>Volume from Image</dt>
    <dd>
    A bootable filesystem stored on OpenStack's "image storage" will be used as a source for a bootable volume.
    It requires OpenStack to create a new volume
    for the instance to boot from, which will automatically be deleted when
    the instance itself is destroyed.
    </dd>
  </dl>
